# Noeval

Noeval is a fexpr-based Lispy programming language and its interpreter.

I created Noeval to explore and better understand some programming language concepts.

Noeval is pronounced /ˈnɔɪvæl/. Like part of the phrase "an*noy val*edictorian".

Noeval is inspired by [Kernel](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html).
